# Authentication

Learn how to authenticate your requests to the BluesMinds API.

## API Keys

BluesMinds uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can create and manage your API keys from the [dashboard](/dashboard/keys).

## Key Types

### Test Keys

**Prefix:** `bm_test_`

Test keys have limited quotas and are meant for development and testing purposes only.

### Live Keys

**Prefix:** `bm_live_`

Live keys are for production use and have full access to your account's quota and features.

## Making Authenticated Requests

Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer bm_live_abc123def456ghi789jkl
```

## Using the SDK

The SDK automatically handles authentication when you provide your API key:

```typescript
import { BluesMinds } from '@bluesminds/sdk';

const client = new BluesMinds({
  apiKey: process.env.BLUESMINDS_API_KEY
});

// All requests are automatically authenticated
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }]
});
```

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Store keys in environment variables
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use test keys for development
- Delete unused keys immediately
