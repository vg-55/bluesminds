# Authentication

Learn how to authenticate your requests to the BluesMinds API using API keys.

## API keys

BluesMinds uses API keys to authenticate requests. Create and manage keys in the [`/dashboard/keys`](/dashboard/keys) page.

### Send the key on every request

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer bm_live_abc123def456ghi789jkl
```

If you are using the SDK, it will set this header automatically.

## Key types

### Test keys (`bm_test_`)

Use test keys for development and CI. They typically have lower quotas and are not intended for production traffic.

### Live keys (`bm_live_`)

Use live keys for production traffic. Treat them as secrets.

## Using the SDK

The SDK automatically handles authentication when you provide your API key:

```typescript
import { BluesMinds } from '@bluesminds/sdk';

const client = new BluesMinds({
  apiKey: process.env.BLUESMINDS_API_KEY
});

// All requests are automatically authenticated
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }]
});
```

## Security best practices

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Store keys in environment variables or a secret manager
- Rotate keys regularly (see [`rotate-api-keys.mdx`](/docs/guides/common-tasks/rotate-api-keys))
- Use test keys for development
- Delete unused keys immediately
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized

- Confirm the header is `Authorization: Bearer <key>`.
- Verify the key is active in `/dashboard/keys`.
- Ensure you are not mixing environments (test key in prod, or vice versa).

## Next steps

- Make a request: [`quickstart.mdx`](/docs/quickstart)
- Explore endpoints: [`api/index.mdx`](/docs/api)
