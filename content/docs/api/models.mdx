# Models

Use the models endpoint to discover which model identifiers are currently available on your gateway. This is the canonical source of truth for model names you can pass to `model` in chat completions.

## Endpoint

```bash
GET https://api.bluesminds.com/v1/models
```

## Authentication

```bash
Authorization: Bearer bm_live_your_api_key
```

## Example request

```bash
curl https://api.bluesminds.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer bm_live_your_api_key"
```

## Example response

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "gpt-4o",
      "object": "model",
      "owned_by": "openai"
    },
    {
      "id": "claude-sonnet-4.5",
      "object": "model",
      "owned_by": "anthropic"
    }
  ]
}
```

## How to use this in your app

### Validate a model name before sending traffic

```ts
const res = await fetch('https://api.bluesminds.com/v1/models', {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.BLUESMINDS_API_KEY}` },
});

if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`models failed: ${res.status}`);

const { data } = await res.json();
const allowed = new Set(data.map((m: { id: string }) => m.id));

if (!allowed.has('claude-sonnet-4.5')) {
  throw new Error('Model not available on this gateway');
}
```

### Build a model picker UI

Use the response to populate a dropdown and store the selected `id` as the model identifier.

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized

- Ensure the `Authorization` header is present and uses `Bearer ...`.
- Verify you are using a valid key (test vs live) and the key is active.

### 404 Not Found

- Confirm you are calling `/v1/models` (not `/models`).
- If self-hosting, confirm your gateway is running and reachable.

### Empty list

- No providers/models are configured on the gateway.
- In self-hosted setups, add providers and model mappings in the admin UI, then retry.

## Next steps

- Use the returned `id` values with [`chat.mdx`](./chat.mdx)
- For model selection guidance, see [`models.mdx`](../guides/models.mdx)
