# Multi-provider load balancing

BluesMinds can route requests across multiple upstream servers/providers to improve reliability and reduce tail latency.

This page describes the operational concepts and common configurations. Exact UI fields may vary by deployment.

## Concepts

### Provider / server

A provider (or server) is an upstream endpoint BluesMinds can send requests to (for example, a LiteLLM proxy or a direct provider API).

### Priority

Lower numbers are tried first. If the primary server is unhealthy or fails, BluesMinds can fall back to the next priority.

### Weight

Weights distribute traffic across servers at the same priority (simple load balancing).

## Common configurations

### Active / passive failover

- **Primary**: priority `1`, weight `1.0`
- **Backup**: priority `2`, weight `1.0`

Use this when you want the backup to receive traffic only when the primary is unhealthy.

### Active / active load balancing

- **Server A**: priority `1`, weight `0.5`
- **Server B**: priority `1`, weight `0.5`

Use this when you want to spread traffic across two equivalent upstreams.

### Regional routing (conceptual)

If you run multiple gateways (one per region), route users to the nearest gateway at the edge (DNS / load balancer), then use provider load balancing within each region.

## Troubleshooting

### Traffic is not balancing as expected

- Ensure servers share the same priority.
- Verify weights are non-zero and sum to a meaningful distribution.
- Check health status in `/admin/providers`.

### Failover does not happen

- Confirm the primary is marked unhealthy (health checks failing).
- Verify a backup server exists with a higher priority number.
- Check logs to see why requests are failing (timeouts vs auth vs validation).

## Next steps

- Add application-level fallbacks: [`model-fallback.mdx`](./common-tasks/model-fallback.mdx)
- Configure a provider (Anthropic example): [`setup-anthropic.mdx`](./setup-anthropic.mdx)
