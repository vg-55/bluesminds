# Rotate API keys

Rotate keys regularly to reduce blast radius and comply with security policies.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the BluesMinds dashboard
- Ability to update your application secrets (CI/CD, secret manager, or environment variables)

## Recommended rotation flow (no downtime)

1. **Create a new key**
   - Create a new key in the dashboard: `/dashboard/keys`
   - Prefer a dedicated key per environment (dev/staging/prod).

2. **Deploy the new key alongside the old key**
   - Update your secret store to include the new key.
   - Deploy your app so it starts using the new key for new requests.

3. **Verify traffic**
   - Confirm requests succeed and usage appears in logs: `/dashboard/logs`.

4. **Revoke the old key**
   - Delete or disable the old key in the dashboard.

## Example: environment variable update

```bash
# old
BLUESMINDS_API_KEY=bm_live_old

# new
BLUESMINDS_API_KEY=bm_live_new
```

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized after rotation

- Ensure the deployed environment is using the new key (not a cached secret).
- Confirm the header is `Authorization: Bearer <key>`.
- If you revoked the old key too early, re-enable it temporarily and repeat the flow.

## Next steps

- Review [`authentication.mdx`](../../authentication.mdx) for key types and security practices
- Add a rotation cadence (e.g., every 90 days) and automate via your secret manager
